# dsh-win-multi-bash v0.1.0

Windows multi-bash plugin for DeepSeek Harness: `git_bash` / `wsl_bash` model tools plus a `shell-select` executor routing the single `ctx.shell` seat across Git Bash, WSL and pwsh. Pwsh stays the default — existing behavior is unchanged until a bash-family tool is called.

## Features

- **`git_bash` tool** — Git for Windows (MSYS) toolchain, auto-resolved (well-known locations → PATH → git.exe layout inference → GitForWindows registry), never the WSL launcher.
- **`wsl_bash` tool** — WSL distro Linux userland; commands ride as base64 payloads so quoting and paths pass verbatim.
- **`shell-select` executor** — routes `request.shell ?? default` across git-bash / wsl-bash / pwsh; pwsh stays the default.
- **Sandboxing** — pwsh: windows-acl restricted token (partial); wsl-bash: bwrap inside the distro (full); git-bash: windows-acl probe (typically unavailable with Git for Windows — `CreateProcessAsUserW` cannot launch MSYS bash).
- **`requireSandbox` hardening (new)** — when a backend's probe fails, refuse unconfined runs unless the effective mode is `danger-full-access`; escalation via `sandbox_permissions` stays available.
- **bwrap denial classification (new)** — denied file effects now report `denied: true` with the `[sandbox: file access denied]` marker (foreground and background paths).
- **MSYS path-conversion guidance** — tool descriptions and README document `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` for native exe calls (e.g. `wsl.exe`) from git_bash.

## Install

```powershell
# hot plug (no restart; recommended)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1

# bundle install (restart dsh web)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-win-multi-bash
# or from source: dsh plugin --profile web add github:@Dinosaur-MC/dsh-win-multi-bash
```

## Sandbox notes (read before use)

- `wsl_bash` sandboxing requires `bubblewrap` inside the distro (`sudo apt-get install -y bubblewrap` on Ubuntu/Debian); the probe verdict is cached for the host process lifetime — restart `dsh web` after installing.
- `git_bash` usually cannot be sandboxed in Git for Windows deployments — do not assume DSH sandbox protection for it; enable `requireSandbox` to refuse unconfined runs outside `danger-full-access`.
- Denials are only classified when the command exits non-zero (matching upstream bash-sandbox rules).

## Verification

`smoke/run.ps1` boots a real composition and verifies `git_bash` / `wsl_bash` register and execute real commands (default and pinned `bashPath` variants).
